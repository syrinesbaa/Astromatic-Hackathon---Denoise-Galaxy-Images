# Astromatic-Hackathon---Denoise-Galaxy-Images
I was fortunate to be the only Tunisian selected among 20 other international students to take part in Astromatic 2022 in Montréal. Me and my team ; Missa and Daniel, AKA Maxwell's Demons , worked on denoising galaxy images using AE and VAE.
We were also lucky to have implemented our model on real world data provided by the Mont-Mégantic Observatory.
